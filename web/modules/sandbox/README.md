# Sandbox Modules Folder
This folder should contains all custom modules created to support a generic feature or functionality. All modules placed under this folder should be project agnostic. 
It should support a feature that could be used among several projects. For each new module, a new folder should be created under `sandbox/` folder and place all the related files for that module inside it.

## Standards

* Naming Convention: `<module-name>`

## Custom Module Folder Structure
