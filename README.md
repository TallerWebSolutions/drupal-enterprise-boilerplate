# Drupal Enterprise Boilerplate
This boilerplate is based on how whe are currently working with Drupal at Taller. It may not be suitable for all kinds of projects and still needs lots of decoupling.

## Dependencies
 - Docker
 - Docker-compose
 - Make

## How to Use

### Installing locally
 - Clone this repository
 - Remove .git folder
 - Now is the moment I suggest you to create your own Git repo and commit the boilerplate code, but it is really up to you
 - Find/replace the following variables (be carefull not to replace in this Readme):

|||
|---|---|
| APP_IMAGE_NAME | The name of the Docker image for your site |
| DB_CONTAINER_NAME | The name of the Docker container with the database |
| CI_ACQUIA_DIR | The name of the folder to use in CI when deploying to Acquia |
| ACQUIA_GIT_DOMAIN | The domain of Acquia's Git repository |
| ACQUIA_GIT_REPO | The Acquia's Git repository of your project |
| GIT_USER_EMAIL | The email to be in the Git config while building in Semaphore and deploying to Acquia |
| GIT_USER_NAME | The name to be in the Git config while building in Semaphore and deploying to Acquia |
| DRUPAL_SITE_NAME | The name of your Drupal site |
| SERVER_ADMIN | Apache server admin |

 - Run `make`
 - If everything went right, you should be able to access your Drupal site in your localhost
 - Commit Drupal generated files

### Coding Standards

#### PHP Code Sniffer
To mantain the [Drupal Coding Standards](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards) in our custom code, we use the [PHPCS](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) lib with the [Coder module](https://www.drupal.org/project/coder).

To run it against your project, use the following command from Makefile:
```
make sniff
```
Some errors in the sniffer can be automatically corrected by running:
```
make beautify
```
The remaining errors you'll have to fix by yourself.

### Deploying
Currently, the integration and delivry features of this boilerplate assume you are using Semaphore CI for building and hosting the environments in Acquia Cloud. Add more generic scripts that can be used to build in other CI systems or deploy in other servers is one of the many improvements we need to do.

 - In the setup of the Semaphore project, place the following command:
```
make ci-setup
```
 - In a job of this project, place the following command:
```
make ci-run
```

### Debugging
If you want to use xdebug for debugging your code you just need to use the command below to enable it (or run the command again to disable):

```
make xdebug
```

**Note:** The command above must be executed within the container, in the folder where the Makefile is located.

You'll receive a message indicating if xdebug is ON or OFF.

Once xdebug is enabled, add breakpoints in the file you want to debug, go to the section Debug in your VSCode (the [PHP Debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug "PHP Debug Adapter for Visual Studio Code") is required) and clicks on the button **Start Debugging** (this button it's located on the top, beside a **Listen for XDebug** text). Now, you just have to access the application in your favorite browser and you'll see your VSCode stopping in the breakpoints you added.

#### To run in Acquia
 - Clone the Acquia repository and add a symlink to docroot named web. This way, the autoload generated by composer will work properly in Acquia servers.

## Features
 - Ready to use Drupal installation
 - Drush
 - Drupal Console
 - Node (with NVM)
 - Pre configured Acquia deploy scripts

## FYI
 - This boilerplate works best with Drupal ^8.5
 - By default, the latest Drupal 8 version is installed
 - You should always commit your composer.lock file
